# Phase 1 findings

What the vertical slice actually measured, and the two places the plan needs
amending. Numbers are from a MacBook Pro M5 Pro (see ENVIRONMENT.md) — not the
Mac mini M2 Pro the plan assumes.

## 1. The model ID in section 2 is ambiguous, and the obvious reading is wrong

WhisperKit's `_turbo` suffix marks a compute variant, not OpenAI's
large-v3-turbo model. Name-matching "large-v3-turbo" gets you
`openai_whisper-large-v3_turbo`, which is the full 1.5B large-v3 with a 1813 MB
decoder. The model you validated offline is `large-v3-v20240930`, whose decoder
is 344 MB — 5.3x smaller.

Since the design re-decodes a 15 s window every 1 s hop, decoder cost dominates
the loop. Getting this wrong would have been both far slower and a *different
model* from the one your offline WER was measured on, quietly invalidating the
Phase 2 exit criterion that compares the two.

Locked to `openai_whisper-large-v3-v20240930_turbo`. Full size table in
ENVIRONMENT.md.

## 2. Section 7's "no fallback ladder" is silent data loss

Section 7 specifies temperature 0.0 with the fallback ladder reserved for
offline cleanup. Implemented literally — `temperatureFallbackCount = 0` — this
does not merely disable a quality feature. It turns WhisperKit's decode gates
into silent drops.

WhisperKit applies four gates to a decoded window: `noSpeechThreshold`,
`logProbThreshold`, `compressionRatioThreshold`, and `firstTokenLogProbThreshold`.
When one trips, the decode is meant to be retried at a higher temperature. With
no fallbacks configured there is nothing to retry with, so the window returns
**empty text and no error**. The orchestrator cannot distinguish that from
silence.

Isolated by disabling each gate independently: `firstTokenLogProbThreshold` is
the one that fires. It bails when the first decoded token looks improbable.

**Why this matters more in Phase 2 than Phase 1.** That gate is designed for
file transcription, where a window starts at a natural boundary. A sliding ring
buffer starts a window mid-word on *every hop*. Low-confidence first tokens are
therefore the normal case, not the exception, and the failure mode is invisible.

**Do not fix it by removing the gate.** With `firstTokenLogProbThreshold`
disabled, a 7 s window decoded to:

> Kalo mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga mga … (438 chars)

That is precisely the repetition loop the risk register's "hallucination"
row exists to prevent. The gate is doing real work.

**What was changed:** the gates stay on, `temperatureFallbackCount` defaults to
2 so a trip retries instead of vanishing, and the server now logs a warning
whenever a window returns no text. Every gate is exposed as a sidecar flag
(`--fallbacks N`, `--no-firsttoken`, `--no-nospeech`, `--no-logprob`,
`--no-compression`) so this can be tuned rather than guessed at.

**Measured impact.** Simulating the Phase 2 geometry exactly -- 15 s window,
1 s hop, 43 hops across the fixture -- counting hops that returned no text:

| Configuration | Empty hops | Median inference | RTF |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| thresholds on, `fallbacks=0` (section 7 as written) | **16 / 43 (37.2%)** | 821 ms | 0.055 |
| thresholds on, `fallbacks=2` (now the default) | 7 / 43 (16.3%) | 891 ms | 0.059 |
| `firstTokenLogProbThreshold` removed | 2 / 43 (4.7%) | 873 ms | 0.058 |

As specified, **more than a third of hops would produce nothing at all**, with no
error anywhere. Two fallbacks more than halves that for ~70 ms. Removing the gate
almost eliminates it and is still the wrong trade, for the reason above.

This is also visible in the end-to-end run: streaming the 57 s fixture through
the server produced 11 segments and one hole, where chunk 11 (45-50 s) decoded
to nothing. The new warning names it:

```
WARNING asr.server: chunk 11 returned no text (5000 ms of audio, 726 ms
inference) -- decode threshold likely tripped
```

**Still open:** the right values. See the caveat below.

## 3. Short windows degrade Tagalog badly — section 3 confirmed

Same audio, same model, different window length:

| Window | Output |
|---|---|
| 3 s | "I'm Gustaf Kayong Lahat. Welcome sa meeting nama." |
| 5 s | "I'm Gustaf Kayong Lahat. Welcome sa meeting Natin Ngayong Umaga." |
| 15 s | "Kumusta kayong lahat, welcome sa meeting natin ngayong umaga. Bagotayo magsimula, gusto kolang i confirm…" |

Reference: *"Kumusta kayong lahat, welcome sa meeting natin ngayong umaga."*

At 3–5 s the decoder renders a Tagalog greeting as English ("I'm Gustaf"). At
15 s it is correct. This is section 3's thesis reproduced on the first day:
the language decision is context-dependent, and starving the decoder of context
makes it fall back to English. It argues for keeping the 15 s window and against
trimming it to buy latency.

## 4. Section 7's concurrency cap of 3 is not reachable

A 15 s window costs a median **~880 ms** of inference. At the specified 1 s hop
that is 88% of one model instance's throughput consumed by a **single** session.
A second concurrent session needs 176% of it.

So with one model instance at 15 s / 1 s, the real cap is **one session**, not
three. The scheduler's drop policy would not be trimming an occasional late hop;
it would be discarding most of the work for every session after the first.

Worse, this is measured on an M5 Pro. The plan targets a Mac mini M2 Pro, which
is slower.

Options, in the order worth trying:

1. **Raise the hop to 1.5-2 s.** Section 7 already lists this as the tuning knob
   when the queue backs up. At a 2 s hop, two sessions fit.
2. **Run more than one model instance.** 24 GB of RAM holds several 1.6 GB
   models; whether the ANE parallelises them is an open question worth measuring
   before assuming.
3. **Accept a cap of one.** If this is solo dictation rather than meetings
   (section 15's open item), this costs nothing -- and it also decides whether
   Phase 6 diarization is needed at all.

Either way the number in section 7 should not survive contact with Phase 3's
load test. Measure the degradation curve early rather than at the end.

## Measured RTF on this machine

| Path | Window | Median inference | RTF |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Sliding (Phase 2 geometry) | 15 s | 891 ms | 0.059 |
| Fixed chunks (Phase 1, end to end) | 5 s | 516 ms | 0.103 |

First model load compiles CoreML for the ANE and took **284 s**. Subsequent
loads hit the cache at **9-11 s**. Worth knowing before assuming a restart is
cheap.

## Caveat: the audio was synthetic

macOS ships no Filipino voice, so the fixture uses the Indonesian one reading a
Taglish script — close in phonology, wrong in acoustics. It also begins at full
amplitude at sample 0 with no lead-in, which is not how real recordings behave
and which is partly why the first window is unusually hostile.

So: findings 1 and 2 are structural and hold regardless of audio. Finding 3
matches the plan's own prediction and is very likely real, but the *specific*
threshold and fallback values must be tuned against your own eval set before
they mean anything. That is Phase 2 work and it needs `eval/audio/` populated.
